FlexTrade App Optimization Project

Project Title
Enhancing E-Commerce Performance through Data-Driven UX Optimization

PROJECT SUMMARY
This project analyzes user behavior within the FlexTrade e-commerce app to identify issues affecting user engagement and sales performance. Using data analytics, I provided actionable insights that led to significant improvements in app usability, customer satisfaction, and conversion rates.

BUSINESS PROBLEM
Despite high download and usage rates, FlexTrade experienced:

High Bounce Rate: 45% of users left after minimal interaction

Cart Abandonment: 30% of users exited with items still in cart

Low Average Order Value: Below industry benchmarks

Intense Competition: In a saturated online shopping market

DATA SOURCE
App Analytics (Bounce rate, session time, funnel drop-offs)

User Behavior Logs (Page views, time spent, cart interactions)

User Feedback (Reviews, complaints, suggestions)

Transaction Records (Frequency and spend per user)

KEY FINDINGS
45% bounce rate due to slow loading and complex navigation

30% cart abandonment rate linked to a buggy checkout process

90+ user feedback entries indicated poor user experience

Users who spent over 10 minutes in the app were 3x more likely to convert

RECOMMENDATION
Fix checkout bugs and performance lags

Streamline checkout to reduce steps

Add personalized product suggestions

Implement upsell and cross-sell strategies

Trigger incentives based on session time and cart value

RESULT AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
Following the implementation of my data-driven recommendations, the bounce rate dropped significantly from 45% to under 30%, indicating improved user engagement and retention.
Cart abandonment rate decreased from 30% to below 20%, reflecting a more streamlined and user-friendly checkout process.
Conversion rate increased by 18%, demonstrating the effectiveness of personalised recommendations and session-based incentives in turning visits into purchases
These insights and recommendations enabled the company to optimise user flow, improve app satisfaction, and ultimately increase revenue per user session.
This project clearly demonstrates how data analytics can transform user experience, streamline operations, and increase profitability in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
It also showcases my ability to:
•   Conduct deep-dive analytical investigations
•   Translate data into actionable business strategies
Communicate insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
