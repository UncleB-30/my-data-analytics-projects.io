									<h2><a href="#">Sales 
										and profitability 
										analysis Using Microsoft Power BI </a></h2>
									<p>This was a significant and unique project, as the company is a global leader in the microchip and robotics industry, with a presence across multiple continents including Europe, Africa, and Asia. The company has a broad portfolio that spans the automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial sectors.

										Despite its strong market presence, the company faced several challenges, including demand volatility, inefficient inventory management, the need to refine sales strategies, difficulty in identifying profitable market opportunities, and issues with production planning.
										
										Using my data analysis, visualisation, and problem-solving skills, I leveraged the available datasets to help the business overcome these obstacles. I developed an automated, data-driven dashboard in Power BI, providing in-depth analysis of sales, profitability, and customer trends.
										
										Based on my recommendations, the company was able to:
										
										Discover new customer segments and regions for expansion
										
										Reduce overstocked products by 15%
										
										Decrease understocked products by 10%
										
										Minimise waste by cutting production costs by 12%

										<h2><a href="#">Enhancing Supply Chain Performance and Customer Satisfaction through Inventory Optimization and Sales Trend Analysis <br />
										</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Camera.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a data analyst supporting the Supply Chain Management team of a top-tier consumer electronics company, I was tasked with analysing large datasets to generate actionable insights and develop optimisation strategies for inventory management. 
										My primary goal for the project was to help the business minimise inventory inefficiencies while enhancing product availability and customer satisfaction.

										I Used advanced data analysis techniques in Excel, and SQL, I developed and implemented a predictive inventory optimisation model. This model enabled the company to reduce overstock and understock incidents by 18%, significantly lowering inventory holding costs and avoiding missed sales opportunities.
										
										In my analysis, I conducted a comprehensive time-series analysis of sales data across various product categories. This enabled stakeholders to clearly understand seasonal demand fluctuations and adapt procurement and distribution strategies accordingly. As a result, the company saw a 12% improvement in inventory turnover ratio and reduced end-of-season stock clearance by 18%.
																							
										Following the implementation of my recommendations, product stockouts during peak sales periods were reduced, leading to a 15% increase in customer satisfaction ratings based on post-purchase surveys and sentiment analysis of customer reviews.

										Additionally, by optimising inventory levels and aligning them with actual sales demand, my analysis contributed to an estimated 8% reduction in warehousing and logistics costs within the first quarter of implementation.</p>

									<h2><a href="#"> Enhancing E-Commerce Performance through Data-Driven User Experience Optimisation<br />
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/customer" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Project Summary
										
										This project was executed for a leading e-commerce platform with a growing user base but underperforming conversion metrics. Despite strong download numbers and app traffic, the business faced issues like high bounce rates, frequent cart abandonment, and low average order value. My role as a Data Analyst was to uncover the reasons behind these patterns, propose data-driven solutions, and quantify potential business impacts.
								
										
										The objectives are to:
										•	Identify and address user experience (UX) issues within the mobile app.
										•	Optimise the checkout process to reduce friction and cart abandonment.
										•	Personalise product recommendations using behavioural data.
										•	Increase overall customer satisfaction and revenue per session.
										
										•	I used Excel (Advanced) – Pivot Tables, Aggregations, Dashboards, and Visualisations 
										•	User Funnel Analysis – Bounce, add-to-cart, checkout, purchase stages
										•	Text Sentiment Analysis – Categorising open user feedback to actualise this project.
										

										 
										"I’m passionate about using data to uncover hidden patterns, solve business problems, and create smarter user journeys.”
										Connect with me if you're hiring for analytical roles in digital products, commerce, or customer strategy.
